## Introduction
These exercises are an introduction to C programming in a 

## Tools

__A good text editor__
C programs are just text, so any good programmer's text editor will do.  I
happen to use `vi`/`vim` since I am familiar with it from long use.
Other editors will do, some people find `nano` is slightly more friendly
to new users.  Editors written for programming tend to have syntax
highlighting and support for navigating through the code, these are helpful
but not essential.

__A C compiler__
Translates the C program into executable instructions
for the target processor.  On \unix\ systems there is usually a `cc`
compiler, most likely a symbolic link to `gcc`

__Terminal/shell__
I tend to have at least two terminals with shell
sessions running.  One in which I have the editor, another where I run the
compiler, and others as needed to read documentation.

__Version control__
Programs are text and so are easy to manage with version control systems (such
as `git`), its good practice so get into the habit of using version
control on your code.

## Creating a C program
Writing a program in C on UNIX systems goes through a familiar cycle.
__Edit__ the code, _save_ the changes, __Compile__ the program
and _fix errors_ that occur at compilation stage.  Then _test_ the
program by __Executing__ it, and revise the program in the light of test
results.

__Editing__ is done in the editor.
```shell-session
$ vi hello.c
$ nano hello.c
```

__Compiling__ is done with the Gnu C Compiler (`gcc`) or
the default C compiler (`cc`).  The command line option `-o` sets the
output filename to `hello` in this case.
```shell-session
$ cc -o hello  hello.c
$ gcc -o hello  hello.c
```

__To Execute__ the program, use the name of the file it is compiled
into as the command.  Depending on how the `PATH` variable is set you may
have to use a `./` prefix.
```shell-session
$ hello
$ ./hello
```

## Exercises

### hello world
  Try the "hello world" program.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main ( int argc, char *argv[] )
{
	puts("Hello world");
}
```
A shell terminal session would look like.
```shell-session
$ vi hello.c
$ cc -o hello hello.c
$ ./hello
Hello World
$
```

### Loops
1. Write a program that prints out a list of diameters and the circumference
   and area of the circle.  You will want a `for` loop, you can write
   expressions for the calculations or use functions.  If you want  a detailed
   explanation of `printf`, try the command `man -s3 printf` in a terminal.
2. Write a program that prints out a set of Fibonacci numbers.  You may want a
   `while` loop in this case.  Try out printing _n_ numbers, and numbers less
   than _h_.
